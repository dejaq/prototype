# The Protocol
The protocol is the “language” of the broker. Both the SDKs and the broker has to speak the same language.
It should not contain any programming language-specific requirements or details. 

Languages we need to support 100%
Go - for broker, tools and official SDK
Java, JavaScript and Python - for the v2 official SDKs

The protocol is stateful. Some commands are dependant by the previous ones. This way we remove most of the fields from the commands. eg: 
A connection is made 
Client does a HandshakeConsumer. The broker now store all the metadata required for this specific connection. No other handshake is allowed from this channel/connection.
Client sends a CreateMessage command - the broker will return an error, knowing that a producer is there not a consumer. There is no need to send the ProducerGroupID.
## Connections
All connections are made on the TCP protocol. 
IPV4 and IPV6 are supported, also strings (hostnames, domains) if they can be resolved by the server.
Each Port can be overridden from the settings. 
Only the Broker will listen for new connections (SDK or other brokers will initiate the connections)

1 consumer has to have 1 active communication channel with at least 1 broker
1 producer has to have 1 active communication channel with at least 1 broker 
1 broker has to have 1 channel to the Consumer in order to push messages, because of the time latency that is required between the broker and consumer is better to have this dedicated connection and to be  as free as possible.
//if we Multiplex we will have 1 TCP connection between consumer-broker for both channels.

1 Process can have multiple consumers and producers instances, meaning 1 process (server) can have multiple TCP connections open to the same broker and/or to multiple brokers.

## Commands 
A command is unique between 2 distinct Actors in the System. A command may be Request/Response or a One-way stream of simple messages. They are sent through one specific channel between 2 distinct actors:
BTC - broker to client
CTB - client to broker

All Commands properties: 
TraceID string
TimeoutMs int

All responses :
errorCode
errorMessage
errorDetails(map)
throttledMs

## Transport
Because of our custom protocol needs, we need a transport layer that is highly customizable and performant. To increase the adoption rate and also use a mature framework we choose gRPC. It will provide us with 
interaction with flow-control at the application layer
cascading call-cancellation
load balancing & failover
Using a custom format (FlatBuffer) is easy to do. As confirmation we also saw a high adoption rate in the new technologies like CoackroachDB and dGraph. 
### Why Not ….

MQTT 5.0: The timelines are ad-hoc (we need persistence)  and The messages are ordered (we need arbitrarly)

HTTP:
Very appealing to use but it will be cumberstone to implement the push feature to a consumer, which is the heart of the system. The broker has to deliver the message exactly when its becoming available. Using long-polling or HTTP2 multiplexing are not ideal. gRPC is built on top of http2 https://grpc.io/faq/

Stomp 1.2:  Very light and simple, maybe we can implement it as an extra wrapper on the binary protocol, to be user friendly for cli, debug and interoperability. It is not compatible with our app and broker-broker communication so we cannot use it internally.

AMQP : Way too complex for our needs, also is not compatible with our arbitrary queues and enforces too many behaviours.

ZeroMQ - at the first glance it looks promising but
The request/response is locking to 1 message, this means we cannot multiplex the connections and is not async. We will want to allow a certain degree of async/wait for replies at the protocol level.
Pub/sub - consumers have their own partition so we do not need a pub’/sub pattern. 
Push/pull (ventilator) - broker can do the push of the messages and consumers are he workers. It may work although we will need more control on the algorithm that splits the tasks. Some code ha to be written for the coordination. Because we use the SyncronizationService to split we will have to bypass/workaround a lot.

## Encoding 

The protocol uses FlatBuffers messages for their performance, RPC capabilities and popularity. The zero-copy memory feature help the broker keeping a low garbage-collector overhead, impact that matters in our time-sensitive app (time and latency).
Docs: https://google.github.io/flatbuffers


### Why Not …
Between all the types of encoding formats, based on our needs we narrow them down to formats that are Binary with zero-copy memory overhead. 

Capnproto - although is pretty popular and the RPC protocol would solve more problems for us, it does not officially support any other language than C++, also there is no user-made RPC Java library. Our simpler message structure will not benefit from extra features it has, like top-bottom reference decoding.
MessagePack: we are looking for something more efficient on the network, its verbosity is not something we need.
ASN1 -It has a low adoption rate.
## Compression 
TODO after we decide the protocol + serialization
We need to support at least 2 compression formats:
Best one for Text 
Best one for binary 
This will allow the USER to choose what kind of data it will put inside message payloads and it will be more effective. This will be a topic-static setting.
TODO - decide where does the compression occurs and how does it affect the protocol (non SDK clients). 
## Encryption 
TODO after we decide the protocol + serialization



# Tools
## CLI client
 Similar with mysql, nodetool it will be main tool for developers and sys admins for interaction with the brokers to test and debug. 
It will be a wrapper for the SDK with the following features:
See the state of the cluster (what brokers and clients exists)
Get basic metrics (connect to metrics endpoints)
Be a client (basic commands, producer and consumer)
Run custom count queries (for range and status of messages)
Basically run all the Protocol commands

The interaction will be done in 2 major ways:
Command line arguments (for simple usages or CI/CD integrations and tests, eg: create messages)
Interactive shell (see redis, cqlsh)

## Docs generator

# Limits & restrictions

Some arbitrary limits will be imposed to improve the safety and blast radius of the cluster, a few of them will be:
 * number of brokers and topics in a cluster eg 1024
 (more restrictions WILL result from the storage) 

## IDs
IDs has to maintain most of the popular hashes and UUIDs formats. They also have to be compatible with all the storage restrictions so we have to allow the smallest number of characters as possible.
The client IDs length should be enough for a large cluster (producer, consumer) needs.

 MessageID - 32 characters, characters allowed: [0-9a-zA-Z-] (61 chars)
 Topic: 32 characters, characters allowed: [0-9a-zA-Z-] 
 ProducerGroupID: 12 characters, characters allowed: [0-9a-zA-Z-] 
 ConsumerID: 12 characters, characters allowed: [0-9a-zA-Z-]
# Settings (not finished)
This will be the result from the Go implementation. There are so many that is hard to see all of them before the actual implementation.
### Broker
maxPrefetchMS: 1200: larger time will increase the accuracy of the messages (delivered to consumers), optimize the systems with larger batches. The downside is that while the messages are on the broker they are not updated, meaning if you have a system where the Producer is updating/deleting (heavy write on the messages with < few seconds until they became available) it will lead to more false-positives.
maxPrefetchCount: 
maxPrefetchSize: 
maxTCPConnections: avoid freezing the server by a bug or DDOS, set the as high as your server and network allows it
maxRAM % (beyond enters degradation)
