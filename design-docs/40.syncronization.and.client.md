# Synchronization service
In the first version we will use etcd as a technology. 

The main responsibilities are:
Keep consensus data for brokers and storage
Cluster configs
Detect network splits (from the broker and SDK levels)
## data/consensus
The consensus data sets are (see broker for more details):
Set of brokers and their metadata (status, ip, latency, timedrift ..)
Ip, ipv6, hostname
Latency from etcd
Avg latency for SDKS
#connections
Version 
timeDrift ms from etcd
timeDraft ms from avg SDKs
lastSeen
Set of Topics (key = name)
Creation date
Shards 
Aprox messages count (to detect LAG)
Available 
total
oldestTimestamp available (aprox)
Setting- replicaCount
Setting- MaxSecondsFutureAllowed (from Now() for timestamp values)
Setting - maxSecondsLease
Setting - checksumBodies (default false) 
Setting - maxBodySizeBytes (default 1mb)
Setting - RQS limit/client 
Setting - minimum Protocol version
Setting - minimum SDK version
Status - creating, live, deleting (provisioning)
brokerIDMaster (mutex/lock) - used for creating and deleting status, only 1 broker can handle this op at a time
Producers

producerGroupID

## Network splits
The network splits will be detected:
Between etcd nodes - its handled by etcd itself
Between brokers/SDKs and etcd nodes - by not being able to connect to a healthy etcd node means that you are in a minority cluster (split)
Between SDK - broker - the SDK can connect to etcd but cannot reach a broker (means that the broker is a connectivity issue or the broker is in a minority split, either way it should reconnect  to another broker)
Between broker - broker: there is no broker-broker connections ?
