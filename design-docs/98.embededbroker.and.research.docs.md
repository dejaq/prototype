# WIP Embedded Storage (new project)

In a bright future, we would want to eliminate the need of an external storage and llet the Broker have an optional role of a Datanode 
## Data node (role)
Any healthy broker can be also a data node, if the cluster has embedded storage enabled. The role can be disabled via config. This includes keeping shards replicas. The responsibilities are
ACID commits
Topic Persistence (messages and writes)
Replication of shards (including detecting failures and network splits)
Queries on data
Deciding which shards live on which brokers (voting system, includes rebalancing too)
Cleanup: remove the messages marked as deleted
Expose stats/metrics 


## Architecture
We will need to use an embeded storage (eg: RocksDB) and build a layer on top for distributed database :
Consistency 
Replication 
Load distribution
Failover and high availability 
Sharding
Query planner with coordinator 
Consues (we already have a syncronziation service)

## Shards 
Version1: Shards will be time-sliced for the timeline with cap (max) documents. If one of them is full we will create a new shard on the same time-slice but on a different server. Write new docs in the latest shard, read from all.  We keep the timestamp of the topic creation. Shard0 is [topicCreation, topicCreation + 15min], and so on 

Version2: like cassandra/elastic search split the documents between shard (partition key = timestamp or ID)

## storage
We can use RocksDB for local storage. Alternatives: InfluxDB, goleveldb, tiedot (https://github.com/numetriclabz/awesome-db#go-lang)
prefix() by timestamp can answer to rangeQueries
Lookup by primary key for lookups 
We store in syncronization service
Each broker state 
Each topic shards
Size
Count
Leader brokerID
Replicas (and their consistency)

# Partial alternatives (approx same effect)
There are other systems that has some overlapped functionalities, but some of them have immutable topics and others do not have persistence. Partially the same properties can be achieved using 

RabbitMQ Delayed Message plugin, which uses a topic with TTL (with no consumers), let the message expire and the exchange will put it in a Dead letter topic, eg: https://www.cloudamqp.com/docs/delayed-messages.html
Multiple kafka topics split by time intervals and a consumer that plays the role of a broker, moving messages from the TTL topics to the main one. 
Messages kept in a DB and a cronjob searching for available timestamps each tick
Kafka topic with Streams that aggregates and arrange data based on the Timestamp. 
JMS ?! 
http://rsocket.io/ ?!
https://nats.io with storage
Akka scheduler 
Celery with schedule (kindof)
